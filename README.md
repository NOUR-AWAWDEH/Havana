# Havana Coffee Shop Application

## Introduction

Writing orders and filling data manually by hand is a very hard job, and its cost businesses a lot of money and time.
Additionally, the possibility of human mistakes rises. To address these challenges, software solutions can be leveraged to automate a lot of work. One such solution is a Coffee Shop Application for Orders.
I will be developing a Coffee Shop Accounting System and Sales of Drinks and Snacks, which I have named "Havana". 
I will try my best to develop this application to solve basic cases that the cashier will meet when communicating with the customer in this Coffee Shop, and also to help the manager to maintain control over the business.
In the next chapters, I will explain more information and details about the development process, the technology I have used, and a small comparison between different technologies.
